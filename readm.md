Hello, Rimmet. I made the website for the challenges, but didn't saw that the API I chose was paid. I then decided to use another API which is again with "food" and the design is implement it as it should. They are similar API's and the output in the website would be the same from both of them. https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
Best Regards.
